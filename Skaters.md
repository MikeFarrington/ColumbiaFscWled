# Do not ask skaters to control power to the lights
- Skaters cannot be trusted to reliably flip the power switch to the lights before, during, or after the show.  
- They have too much to think about and have forgotten when initially tasked with doing so.
- The designated lighting operator must power-up the control boxes before each show, after delivering and mounting the batteries.
