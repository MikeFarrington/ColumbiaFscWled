# Powering Lighting Control Boxes

The power draw of the lights during a show has not been fully measured.  Tests should be run operating the lights for expected intervals at target intensity to ensure batteries can make it through a show and be recharged suffficiently for a second showing on the same day.

The input voltage required is between 12V and 36V DC.

A mix of batteries has been used, both newer higher-energy batteries and older degrade lower-energy batteries.  The batteries should be fully charged before each show day, and should be recharged between each show (as quickly and for as long as possible).

Three styles of battery packages have been used:
- 4S tray of of four 18650 cells (newer high energy batteries)
- 4SP2 tray of eight 18650 cells (older low energy and degraded batteries are doubled-up to last longer)
- Enclosed: An enclosed battery with exposed battery terminals

A fourth style can also be used:
- An enclosed commercial-sold non-hobbyist batter (such as power tool or battery bank) so long as it has a compatibly-sized center-positive barrel connector that outputs within the expected voltage range.
